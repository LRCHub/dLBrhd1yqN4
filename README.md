[00:00.63] Before we go any further, friends
[00:02.95] As you call? em they call you when they need somethin'
[00:05.34] Trees for the blunt, two G's for the frontin
[00:07.50] I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
[00:10.66] Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
[00:12.87] Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
[00:15.61] Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
[00:17.79] At least so you could see the white of their eyes
[00:19.95] Bright with surprise once they finish spittin lies
[00:22.51] Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggaz, homies?
[00:25.53] Close, but really don't know me
[00:27.51] Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
[00:30.47] Some come around when they need some money
[00:32.59] Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
[00:34.89] Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
[00:37.39] You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
[00:39.73] Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
[00:42.53] So nowadays he ain't so friendly
[00:44.78] Actually they wouldn't even made a worthy enemy
[00:47.45] Read the signs, no feeding the baboon
[00:49.74] Seein as how they got your back bleeding from the stab wounds
[00:52.40] Y'all know the dance, they smile in your face, y'all know the glance
[00:55.59] Try ta put 'em on, they blow the chance
[00:57.52] Never let your so-called mans know your plans
[00:59.88] How many of us have them? A show of hands
[01:02.55] Friends is a term some people use loosely
[01:04.92] I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see
[01:07.42] You telling me, I try to act broke
[01:09.72] Jealousy, the number one killer among black folk
[01:12.49] Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
[01:14.97] Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc
[01:17.45] Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
[01:19.94] I check the dictionary for the meanin of Friends
[01:21.91] It said, person, one who likes to socialize with
[01:24.85] Sympathize and help her and that's about the size of it
[01:27.50] Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
[01:29.78] To bolster the crime they opt to shoot you through your eyelid
[01:32.16] And they can't hide it goin wild like a white bitch
[01:34.68] Sometimes you need to cut niggaz off like a light switch
[01:37.54] Click, and when things get quiet
[01:39.78] Catch 'em like a thief in the night, (bow) what a riot
[01:42.22] I first met Mister Fantastik at a arms deal
[01:44.75] Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms will feel
[01:47.36] When it get for real the steel get to sparkin
[01:49.91] Everything darken and ain't no talkin
[01:52.25] For somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
[01:54.65] You better off focusing than tryin to plot the bubble
[01:57.33] Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got
[02:00.08] One's we can depend on, friends
[02:02.84] Some come in the form of co-dependence
[02:04.79] A lotta times only end up bein co-defendants
[02:07.22] Ten bucks say theyll tell for a lower sentence
[02:09.45] And leave you up under the jail beggin for a penance
[02:12.08] It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
[02:14.75] Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty
[02:17.44] I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory
[02:19.73] How many of us have a similar story?
[02:22.38] Before lovers we used to have some type of over standing
[02:25.25] Just so when I let her get the man-thing she know its no strings
[02:28.15] We could do the damn thing but, hoe, its no rings
[02:30.87] Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again?
[02:33.83] That depends on how good was the skins
[02:35.61] And could she memorize the lessons
[02:37.61] It ain't no need to pretend
[02:39.44] Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they just, friends
[02:41.96] Friends, how many of us have them?
[02:46.92] Friends, ones we can depend on?
[02:51.92] Friends, how many of us have them?
[02:57.03] Friends, before we go any further
